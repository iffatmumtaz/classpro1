In Pythonüêç, is and in operators serve distinct purposes. Below, I explain their differences, use cases, and provide examples to demonstrate their usage.

1. The is Operator
Purpose: The is operator checks for identity, meaning it tests whether two variables or objects point to the same memory location (i.e., they are the same object).
Use Case: Commonly used to compare objects with None, check if two variables refer to the same object, or verify object identity.
Returns: True if the objects are identical (same memory address), False otherwise.
Note: It does not compare the values or contents of objects, only their identity.

Use is when you need to verify if two variables point to the same object or when checking for None.
Use in when you need to check if an element exists within an iterable.
Understanding the distinction between identity (is) and membership (in) is crucial for writing correct and efficient Python code.

| Operator | Kya karta hai?                | Example Result   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | Identity check (same object?) | `a is b`         |
| `in`     | Membership check (inside?)    | `3 in [1, 2, 3]` |
